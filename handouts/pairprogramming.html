<h1 align="center">Pair Programming</h1>
Pair programming is an aspect of Extreme Programming that is gaining
popularity in industry. [Williams 2000] describes pair programming as:
<blockquote>a practice in which two programmers work side-by-side at
one computer,
continuously collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or
test. This method has been demonstrated to improve productivity and
the quality of software products.
</blockquote>
<p>
Students are
<b>required to abide</b> by the rules given below for the labs.

<h3>Rules</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> <i>Share</i>. <br>
"In pair programming, two programmers are assigned to jointly produce
one artifact (design, algorithm, code, among others). ...
One person is typing or writing [driving], the other is continually
reviewing the work [navigating]. ... Both partners own everything."
    <p>Not only is this an effective learning technique, it is also <b>more</b>
productive than splitting a task in two, working on each half
separately,
and then combining the two.
    </p>
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <i>Play fair</i>. <br>
It is important to take turns typing or writing [driving], so that the
other
person gets a chance to review [navigate]. You will be reminded to
alternate roles every 30 minutes in lab.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <i>Clean up</i>. <br>
Defects belong to the pair. Having two sets of <i>eye balls</i> is
much better than one.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <i>Hold hands and stay together</i>. <br>
All programming should be done <b>together</b>; do not create things
done alone. The literature of pair programming shows that most defects
are traceable to things done singly. It also inhibits learning.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> <i>Say you're sorry</i>. <br>
"<i>Ego-less programming</i> ... is essential for effective pair
programming." Do not insist on having things your way or else.
Do not get defensive about criticism. Work things out as a pair.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Class-Specific Rules</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> You will be assigned a new pair-programming partner once every
two to three weeks.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> If your partner does not show up within 10 minutes into the lab,
you will be assigned a new partner.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> If you show up more than 10 minutes late to the lab, you will be
expected to complete the lab alone.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Occassionally you may be assigned to a three-person group.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> You must keep up with the class to be assigned a partner.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you fall behind on your homework assignments (missing more
than two), you will also not be assigned a partner.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Pairs are required to <b>work together</b>; any form of
    <i>splitting up the work</i> is a violation of pair programming.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h3>Violations of Pair Programming</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li> Taking turns doing the assignments.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Starting from code that one person has already written.
Individually produced code should be treated as a throwaway prototype.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> Splitting the assignment in two and each doing half.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> One person doing all (most of) the work and the other partner
putting their name on it, as though the latter had contributed
equally.
    <p> </p>
  </li>
  <li> One member of a pair coming to see me about an assignment
without
their partner.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h3>Pair Programming Report</h3>
<p>Each individual student will be required to report individual logs
for
each assignment, describing:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>time spent driving, observing, and working alone
  </li>
  <li>confidence in solution
  </li>
  <li>satisfaction with the experience.
  </li>
</ul>
Each student will also be required to rate their partner on a scale of
1-20 for each of the following questions:
<ol>
  <li>Did your partner read preparatory materials
before coming to the scheduled lab? </li>
  <li>Did your partner do his or her
fair share of the work? </li>
  <li>Did your partner cooperatively follow the
pair programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator)?
  </li>
  <li>Did your partner make contributions to the completion of the lab
assignment? </li>
  <li> Did your partner cooperate? </li>
</ol>
A good partner would be rated 20 points for all five categories, for a
total score of 100 points.
<p>All pair-programming partners will earn the same grade for
each lab, unless someone is consistently rated poorly by
his or her partners. After a warning, if his or her
ratings do not improve, that student's lab grades will be lowered (the
final grade would be a function of the partner's rating and the pair's
grade for the lab).
